Once upon a time, there is a boy who hated books. He would only read books that will get his homework done. And if the request was more than that, he would call quits. He hated books in general, but loves reading articles online (Thank you lord for creating internet.). He would spend thousands of hours reading arcticles online, but he wouldn't even spend half a minute with books. Although he knows that reading books are beneficial, but it does not matter to him in one bit.
